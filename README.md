# `treefmt-on-save`

A quick plugin for [Pulsar](https://pulsar-edit.dev/) that formats files on save using [treefmt](https://github.com/numtide/treefmt).

This has been thrown together quickly as a means to an end and thrown up on github in case it’s useful to anyone else. I make no promises I’ll ever touch it again ;)

Share and enjoy!
